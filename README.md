# Google Primer app
<br />

As Senior Writer at the educational mobile app Google Primer, I was responsible for producing all creative content, product & UX copy, and marketing materials. I worked with a small team, collaborating daily with product, design, and marketing specialists. Primer was available in over 10 languages and even more locations around the world, meaning the copy I wrote needed to be easily translatable and applicable to the professional lives of a variety of international audiences.
<br />
<br />
Since Primer was an educational app, its lesson content was essential. My job was to turn complex business topics into short, 5-minute lessons that anyone could understand and quickly apply to their business or career. Each lesson included easily digestible cards, plus interactions that I wrote and coded in JSON.

In addition to producing creative content, I was responsible for all of Primer’s product and marketing copy. During my time at Primer, I oversaw several major product updates, including the creation of a searchable lesson catalog, the addition of new skills, and an update of our onboarding process: 

### Searchable lesson catalog
Previously, the only way to explore Primer’s offerings was to download the app. To make our content more searchable, I led an effort to overhaul our website. I chose the heading “Lesson Catalog,” and created brief descriptions of Primer’s skills (e.g. Workplace Inclusivity, Career Development, Staffing) and of the macrocategories these skills belong to (e.g. Business & Operations, Brand & Identity), all the while mindful of keywords, SEO, and behavioral science.

### New skills
Below is the launch alert and user flow that went out to existing Primer users when we added 8 new skills to the lesson catalog. This allowed users to review and update their chosen skills, which influences what lessons and minicourses appear in their Home tab.

### Segmented onboarding
To further personalize the app experience for users, we added 4 distinct personas users can pick from, and updated the onboarding process accordingly. When choosing titles for the personas and language for the onboarding screens, I paid close attention to research our marketing team had done on segmented value propositions and consulted with Google’s Behavioral Economics team and Material Design best practices.

Finally, in addition to writing short copy, I turned Primer lessons into longer-form pieces which I have ghostwritten for the Google’s marketing blog Think with Google (link in image below).
