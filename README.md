# Google Primer - Content, Product & UX, Marketing
<br />
As Senior Writer at the educational mobile app Google Primer, I’m responsible for producing all creative content, product & UX copy, and marketing materials. I work on a small team and collaborate daily with product, design, and marketing specialists. Primer is available in over 10 languages and even more markets around the world, meaning the copy I write needs to be easily translatable and applicable to the professional lives of a variety of audiences.
<br />
<br />
Since Primer is an educational app, its lesson content is essential. My job is to turn complex business topics into short, 5-minute lessons that are easy for anyone to understand and swiftly apply in their real-life business or career. Each lesson includes easily digestible cards, plus interactions that I write and code in JSON.

In addition to producing creative content, I'm responsible for all of Primer’s product and marketing copy. During my time at Primer, I have overseen several major product updates, including the creation of a searchable lesson catalog, the addition of new skills, and an update of our onboarding process: 

## Searchable lesson catalog

Previously, the only way to explore Primer’s offerings was to download the app. To make our content more searchable, I selected the heading “Lesson Catalog,” and created brief descriptions of Primer’s skills (e.g. Workplace Inclusivity, Career Development, Staffing) and of the macrocategories these skills belong to (e.g. Business & Operations, Brand & Identity), all the while mindful of keywords and SEO.
<br />

## New skills

Above is the launch alert that went out to existing Primer users when we added 8 new skills to the lesson catalog. This allowed users to review and update their chosen skills, which influences what lessons and minicourses appear in their Home tab.

## Segmented onboarding

To further personalize the app experience for users, we added 4 distinct personas users can pick from, and updated the onboarding process accordingly. I paid close attention to research our marketing team had done on the value proposition of segmenting users and consulted with Google’s Behavioral Economics team to choose titles for the four personas and language to accompany the onboarding screens.
